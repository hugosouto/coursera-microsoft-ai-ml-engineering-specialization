Name,Description
training_data,Input   The training data to be used within the experiment. It should contain both training features and a label column (optionally a sample weights column).
target_column_name,"str   The name of the label column. This parameter is applicable to training_data, validation_data and test_data parameters"
primary_metric,"The metric that Automated Machine Learning will optimize for model selection. Automated Machine Learning collects more metrics than it can optimize. For more information on how metrics are calculated, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-auto-train#primary-metric. Acceptable values: accuracy, AUC_weighted, norm_macro_recall, average_precision_score_weighted, and precision_score_weighted Defaults to accuracy"
enable_model_explainability,"bool   Whether to enable explaining the best AutoML model at the end of all AutoML training iterations. The default is None. For more information, see Interpretability: model explanations in automated machine learning."
weight_column_name,"str   The name of the sample weight column. Automated ML supports a weighted column as an input, causing rows in the data to be weighted up or down. If the input data is from a pandas.DataFrame which doesn't have column names, column indices can be used instead, expressed as integers. This parameter is applicable to training_data and validation_data parameters"
validation_data,Input   The validation data to be used within the experiment. It should contain both training features and label column (optionally a sample weights column). Defaults to None
validation_data_size,"float   What fraction of the data to hold out for validation when user validation data is not specified. This should be between 0.0 and 1.0 non-inclusive. Specify validation_data to provide validation data, otherwise set n_cross_validations or validation_data_size to extract validation data out of the specified training data. For custom cross validation fold, use cv_split_column_names. For more information, see Configure data splits and cross-validation in automated machine learning. Defaults to None"
n_cross_validations,"Union[str, int] 		  How many cross validations to perform when user validation data is not specified. Specify validation_data to provide validation data, otherwise set n_cross_validations or validation_data_size to extract validation data out of the specified training data. For custom cross validation fold, use cv_split_column_names. For more information, see Configure data splits and cross-validation in automated machine learning. Defaults to None"
cv_split_column_names,List[str] 		  List of names of the columns that contain custom cross validation split. Each of the CV split columns represents one CV split where each row are either marked 1 for training or 0 for validation. Defaults to None
test_data,Input   The Model Test feature using test datasets or test data splits is a feature in Preview state and might change at any time. The test data to be used for a test run that will automatically be started after model training is complete. The test run will get predictions using the best model and will compute metrics given these predictions. If this parameter or the test_data_size parameter are not specified then no test run will be executed automatically after model training is completed. Test data should contain both features and label column. If test_data is specified then the target_column_name parameter must be specified. Defaults to None
test_data_size,"float   The Model Test feature using test datasets or test data splits is a feature in Preview state and might change at any time. What fraction of the training data to hold out for test data for a test run that will automatically be started after model training is complete. The test run will get predictions using the best model and will compute metrics given these predictions. This should be between 0.0 and 1.0 non-inclusive. If test_data_size is specified at the same time as validation_data_size, then the test data is split from training_data before the validation data is split. For example, if validation_data_size=0.1, test_data_size=0.1 and the original training data has 1000 rows, then the test data will have 100 rows, the validation data will contain 90 rows and the training data will have 810 rows. For regression based tasks, random sampling is used. For classification tasks, stratified sampling is used. Forecasting does not currently support specifying a test dataset using a train/test split. If this parameter or the test_data parameter are not specified then no test run will be executed automatically after model training is completed. Defaults to None"
